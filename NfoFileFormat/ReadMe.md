## Overview

**NfoFileFormat** is a library that provides classes for handling NFO media metadata files. These files are commonly used in conjunction with media management software like Kodi, TinyMediaManager, and Jellyfin. This library enables developers to easily parse, manipulate, and generate NFO files, facilitating better media organization and metadata management.

## Features

- **NFO File Parsing**: Parse existing NFO files to extract media metadata.
- **Metadata Manipulation**: Modify the contents of NFO files programmatically.
- **NFO File Generation**: Create new NFO files with customized metadata.
- **NFO File Updating**: Update existing NFO files with modified metadata.
